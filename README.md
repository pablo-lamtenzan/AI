# AI projects and LibAI

AI library implementation from scratch, working in AI projects for learn diferents kinds of Neural Networks and 
adding at the same time functions to the AIlib.

For the moment the lib is codded in Python, but in the future it will be in C++ too and probally in C.

The objective of this project is to have functions like Pytorch or TensorFlow created from scrach looking to ,in the end,
having an absolute mathematical vision and comprehension of AI. For the moment numpy is used but 
it will be recoded too.
