# AI library implemented from scrach, doing AI projects to learn diferents kinds of Neural Networks and 
adding at the same time functions to the lib.

For the moment the lib is codded in Python, but in the future it will be in C++ and probally in C.

The objective of this project is to have functions like Pytorch or TensorFlow, but created from scrach looking
to have absolute mathematical vision and comprehension of AI as result. For the moment numpy is used but 
it will be recoded too.
